# Lingo Bingo

A game inspired by some coworkers seeking relief from the ridiculous
corporate-speak we endured on all those conference calls. Unbeknownst to us, the
[concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword_bingo) has actually existed for
quite a while. But that's no reason not to online-ify it!

Play a few rounds with the [live demo](https://adamfriedl.com/lingo-bingo/).

## About
